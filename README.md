# GMCensusData
Program to gather Census Bureau data from the API.
Put data into .csv file in columns such that the data is aligned column-wise as: for params..., in params...; then populate the rows with the data to be gathered from each:

As an example, this input would have just "zip+code+tabulation+area" as the for parameter, so it would be the first column. Then "state" is the in parameter so it's the second column.
